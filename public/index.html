            <p>If you are interested in one of our wedding cakes we advise you to come to The Cake Parlour in Wimbledon Park to meet Zoe and have a consultation to talk through your wedding plans, style and initial ideas. The consultation includes a cake tasting for up to three people and you will be able to sample five delicious cake flavour combinations from our menu. There is a fee of Â£20.00 for all cake consultations which is deducted from the cost of the cake if you place an order. Should you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment we require at least 48 hours notice.</p>
